Home Assistant custom integration for electricity-meter data from the Slovenian **Moj Elektro** service using the official Informatika.si API.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This repository is a maintained fork of [frlequ/homeassistant-mojelektro](https://github.com/frlequ/homeassistant-mojelektro).**
>
> The original project, authorship and MIT license are preserved. This fork exists to keep the integration compatible with current Home Assistant releases, fix outstanding issues and continue development against the current Moj Elektro API.

## Current status

**Maintained fork:** `jursko90/homeassistant-mojelektro`  
**Maintainer:** [`jursko90`](https://github.com/jursko90)  
**Current version:** `0.2.7`  
**Home Assistant baseline:** `2025.1+`  
**API:** `https://api.informatika.si/mojelektro/v1`

Version 0.2.7 is primarily a **compatibility and stability release**. New API functionality is planned for the 0.3.x series.

## What the integration currently provides

- 15-minute imported and exported energy readings
- daily imported/exported energy
- monthly imported/exported energy
- peak/off-peak tariff readings where available
- daily consumption grouped by network tariff block
- contracted power for blocks 1-5
- Home Assistant UI config flow
- configurable decimal precision
- automatic token reauthentication flow
- stable entities across temporary partial API responses

Moj Elektro is **not a real-time source**. Meter readings are typically available with an approximately **24-hour delay**. Data can also be incomplete or temporarily inaccurate while the upstream service aggregates readings, especially during the overnight period (roughly midnight to 06:00). Dashboards and automations should therefore not treat the 15-minute sensors as near-real-time measurements.

## Why this fork exists

The original integration remained useful, but several Home Assistant compatibility issues accumulated while upstream development slowed down.

The first maintained-fork release addresses, among other things:

- blocking file I/O inside the Home Assistant event loop
- Home Assistant 2026.12 device-registry compatibility
- modern `SensorEntity.native_value` usage
- safer `DataUpdateCoordinator` startup and update handling
- proper authentication, connection and API-request error handling
- reauthentication when an API token expires or is revoked
- duplicate EIMM/config-entry protection
- deterministic entity unique IDs
- safer handling of incomplete Moj Elektro API responses
- contracted-power validity on the final day of a validity period
- removal of unused runtime dependencies
- refreshed HACS and CI metadata

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for release details.

## Upstream work reviewed

This fork does not claim the upstream work as new work. Relevant open upstream pull requests and issues were reviewed and either incorporated, adapted or intentionally deferred.

| Upstream item | Contributor | Status in this fork | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [PR #59](https://github.com/frlequ/homeassistant-mojelektro/pull/59) | [`kosl`](https://github.com/kosl) | **Adapted / superseded** | Fix for blocking `manifest.json` reads. The fork removes the runtime file read entirely and uses the integration version directly. |
| [PR #60](https://github.com/frlequ/homeassistant-mojelektro/pull/60) | [`mikrohard`](https://github.com/mikrohard) | **Included** | Fixes contracted-power sensors on the last day of the validity period by comparing dates instead of full datetimes. |
| [PR #64](https://github.com/frlequ/homeassistant-mojelektro/pull/64) | [`MaJerle`](https://github.com/MaJerle) | **Included** | Documentation updated to the current Moj Elektro portal wording: `API storitve`. |
| [PR #57](https://github.com/frlequ/homeassistant-mojelektro/pull/57) | [`kosl`](https://github.com/kosl) | **Reviewed / deferred** | Changes the 15-minute-data window to avoid incomplete overnight data. This needs validation against the current API before inclusion. |
| [PR #58](https://github.com/frlequ/homeassistant-mojelektro/pull/58) | [`kosl`](https://github.com/kosl) | **Reviewed / planned** | Adds total meter readings. Planned as part of the 0.3.x API refresh rather than mixed into the stability release. |

### Upstream issues addressed in 0.2.7

- [#54 – blocking call](https://github.com/frlequ/homeassistant-mojelektro/issues/54)
- [#62 – blocking/database executor warnings](https://github.com/frlequ/homeassistant-mojelektro/issues/62)
- [#63 – integration slowdowns caused by blocking I/O](https://github.com/frlequ/homeassistant-mojelektro/issues/63)
- [#65 – non-string device model, breaking in HA 2026.12](https://github.com/frlequ/homeassistant-mojelektro/issues/65)

Upstream [issue #66](https://github.com/frlequ/homeassistant-mojelektro/issues/66) requesting **souporaba** data is part of the planned 0.3.x work.

## Installation

### HACS

This fork is installed as a **custom HACS repository**.

1. Open **HACS**.
2. Open the menu and choose **Custom repositories**.
3. Add:

   `https://github.com/jursko90/homeassistant-mojelektro`

4. Select category **Integration**.
5. Install **Moj Elektro**.
6. Restart Home Assistant.

If the original HACS-default integration is already installed, remove or replace it with this repository before testing the maintained fork.

### Manual installation

Copy:

`custom_components/mojelektro`

into your Home Assistant:

`/config/custom_components/mojelektro`

Then restart Home Assistant.

## Moj Elektro API setup

Official API documentation:

https://docs.informatika.si/mojelektro/api/

1. Sign in to **Moj Elektro**.
2. Open **API storitve**.
3. Create an API token with the desired expiration.
4. Copy the generated token.
5. Find the required **EIMM** identifier under your metering-point information.
6. In Home Assistant open **Settings → Devices & services → Add integration → Moj Elektro**.
7. Enter the token and EIMM.

No `configuration.yaml` entry is required.
